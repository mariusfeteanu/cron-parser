Comma ( , )
    Commas are used to separate items of a list. For example, using "MON,WED,FRI" in the 5th field (day of week) means Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

Minus sign( - )
    Minus sign defines ranges. For example, 2000-2010 indicates every year between 2000 and 2010, inclusive.



Hash (#)
    '#' is allowed for the day-of-week field, and must be followed by a number between one and five. It allows specifying constructs such as "the second Friday" of a given month.[14] For example, entering "5#3" in the day-of-week field corresponds to the third Friday of every month.

Question mark (?)
    In some implementations, used instead of '*' for leaving either day-of-month or day-of-week blank. Other cron implementations substitute "?" with the start-up time of the cron daemon, so that ? ? * * * * would be updated to 25 8 * * * * if cron started-up on 8:25am, and would run at this time every day until restarted again.[15]

Slash (/)
    In vixie-cron, slashes can be combined with ranges to specify step values.[3] For example, */5 in the minutes field indicates every 5 minutes (see note below about frequencies). It is shorthand for the more verbose POSIX form 5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55,00. POSIX does not define a use for slashes; its rationale (commenting on a BSD extension) notes that the definition is based on System V format but does not exclude the possibility of extensions.[2]
